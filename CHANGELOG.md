## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Changed TypeScript activated-device startup so root `TrellisDevice.connect(...)`
  is runtime-only, Deno devices use `checkDeviceActivation(...)` to learn
  whether activation is ready or still required, hidden Deno activation-state
  persistence is scoped by deployment origin, device identity, and contract
  digest, and the JS device demos, design docs, and device guide now follow the
  `checkDeviceActivation(...)` then `connect(...)` flow.
- Redesigned `@qlever-llc/trellis-svelte` around app-owned separate contexts:
  `createTrellisProviderContexts<TContract>()` now bundles Trellis, auth, and
  connection-state contexts for `TrellisProvider`, the old runtime-bag design is
  gone, and the design docs, SvelteKit guide, and browser demo app now show the
  `contexts`-based integration path.
- Changed service-owned KV from an opened-at-startup helper pattern to a
  schema-backed contract surface: `resources.kv.<alias>` now requires `schema`,
  `service.kv.<alias>` and handler `trellis.kv.<alias>` are directly typed
  stores, and public service-author guidance now leads only with
  `TrellisService.connect(...)` rather than exposing Trellis-internal bootstrap
  helpers.
- Made the JavaScript service jobs lifecycle service-owned by removing public
  `jobs.startWorkers()`, making `jobs.<queue>.handle(...)` synchronous, and
  starting and stopping registered job workers through `service.wait()` /
  `service.stop()` instead.
- Changed TypeScript contract discovery and authoring guidance so
  single-contract projects may use a top-level `contract.ts` or `contract.js`,
  updated design and guide docs to describe that layout, and migrated the JS
  demos from one-file `contracts/` folders to root `contract.ts` modules.
- Renamed the TypeScript service runtime package from
  `@qlever-llc/trellis/host*` to `@qlever-llc/trellis/service*`, aligned the
  extracted service handler types to `RpcHandler`, `JobHandler`, and
  `OperationHandler`, and updated design docs and demo examples to show the
  canonical single-object handler callback shape with the narrow injected
  service `trellis` facade.
- Changed `trellis auth login` to require a positional Trellis URL, renamed the
  persisted admin-session URL field to `trellis_url`, and updated the related
  design and guide examples.
- Changed TypeScript `prepare` so service and app contracts generate concrete
  consumer `client.ts` facade types, SvelteKit-style `src/lib/contract.ts`
  contracts are discovered, and app contracts produce TypeScript SDKs without
  Rust SDK crates.
- Updated Svelte app integration so `createTrellisApp` can bind generated client
  facade types and app-local `getTrellis()` helpers return concrete generated
  clients without app-local casts or handwritten overloads.
- Simplified portal auth by removing the portal contract kind and portal
  `appContractId`, keeping custom portals as routing config, and moving
  authenticated device activation to a single `Auth.ActivateDevice` operation.

### Added

- Added a reusable Svelte `DeviceActivationController` for custom and built-in
  authenticated device portal flows.
- Made service and activated-device runtime NATS lifecycle logging explicit so
  disconnects, reconnect attempts, reconnect success, stale connections, and
  connection errors produce distinct operator-facing messages.
- Moved contract-manifest job queue declarations to canonical top-level `jobs`
  in both the JavaScript and Rust contract layers, and aligned bootstrap and
  contract-get views with that shape.

### Fixed

- Fixed Trellis local watched restarts to exit cleanly after shutdown, bounded
  HTTP listener drain during Trellis control-plane shutdown, and aligned
  service-author docs and JS demo shutdown examples with that deterministic exit
  pattern.
- Fixed schema-backed KV validation so invalid stored values now surface read or
  watch errors instead of being auto-deleted, and delayed service heartbeat
  publishing until required KV bootstrap succeeds.
- Fixed `trellis-generate` top-level contract discovery to reject ambiguous
  duplicate layouts while ignoring helper modules named `contract.ts` or
  `contract.js` that do not default export a contract, while also skipping
  `.worktrees/` during contract discovery.
- Granted KV-backed services JetStream info access so operation handlers can
  open their durable operation store without `$JS.API.INFO` permission errors.
- Fixed jobs worker permission grants for cancellation subscriptions and made
  server shutdown idempotent while NATS draining is already in progress.
- Corrected demo workspace generated-SDK resolution during contract prepare,
  wrote local TypeScript SDKs into the owning nested JS workspace, and switched
  local generated Trellis imports to repo-relative runtime paths.
- Fixed `TrellisClient.connect(...)` and `TrellisDevice.connect(...)` so
  contract-driven RPC request typing is inferred from the passed contract rather
  than widening typed responses like `Auth.Me` to `unknown`.
- Fixed activated-device state flows by preserving top-level contract `state`
  metadata, refreshing device reconnect permissions from the presented digest,
  and encoding state KV keys safely so the JavaScript state demo runs
  end-to-end.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- Made TypeScript jobs and named stores first-class client surfaces.
- Split the JavaScript demo into more focused inspection surfaces.

### Changed

- Switched public async APIs to `AsyncResult` and hardened operation startup and
  transfer flows.
- Simplified runtime auth wiring by removing binding tokens and advertising
  native client NATS endpoints.

### Fixed

- Aligned detached agent login and revocation behavior.
- Stabilized console profile loading across reconnects, supported optional
  portal app contracts, and trimmed login portal files from the runtime image.
